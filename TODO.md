### Todos 
 - [ ] Break up project into the pure module, create simple API
   - [ ] Break out normal mapping demo as an app that uses the module.
 - [ ] Get the basic relit module going.
  - [ ] Include documentation including coordinate systems (of light and normal maps)
 - [ ] Improve arrow renderer to indicate z direction (make arrow head 3d like so you can see which direction it's pointing)
 - [ ] Make it so the alpha of the diffuse image is respected 
 - [ ] Simplify code to something near this:
   - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_drawing_a_quad.htm
 - Write blog articles
  - 1) Announcing relit and explaining normal mapping
  - 2) Describe normal map generation from photos
  - 3) Describe how to paint normal maps (Show 2D rendered demo, and link to other projects)
 - [x] Create a converter for fixing normal maps using a different coordinate system
 - [x] Create a page that generates a normal map reference sphere set

### Todos 
 - [ ] Get the basic relit module going.
  - [ ] Include documentation including coordinate systems (of light and normal 
 - [ ] Change system to a point light via per vertex lighting
 - [ ] Automate generating releases including making attachments for browser build.
   - Look for potential projects already doing this. This looked promising:
     - https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-releases
 - [ ] Break up project into the pure module, create simple API
   - [ ] Break out normal mapping demo as an app that uses the module.
 maps)
 - [ ] Improve arrow renderer to indicate z direction (make arrow head 3d like so you can see which direction it's pointing)
 - [ ] Make it so the alpha of the diffuse image is respected 
 - [ ] Simplify code to something near this:
   - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_drawing_a_quad.htm
 - Write blog articles
  - [ ] 1) Announcing relit and explaining normal mapping
  - [ ] 2) Describe normal map generation from photos
    - [ ] Mention simplified method for just creating a 2d normal map. Tiling being one of the more difficult parts. 
  - [ ] 3) Describe how to paint normal maps (Show 2D rendered demo, and link to other projects)
  - [ ] 4) Maybe write up how to use a renderer: three.js or other 3D tools to generate normal maps. Ideally I can create a normal map override for three.js (but do gouraud shading this time.)
 - [x] Create a converter for fixing normal maps using a different coordinate system
 - [x] Create a page that generates a normal map reference sphere set
